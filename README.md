The public version of my Trading program for use on Robinhood

This is a work in progress.  I will include instructions for use and installation when I have more time.

I am currently running this program on a cloud server with a return of about 3% weekly.

Future updates include:
    - convert to GUI
    - Trade results to be accessible on an Apache Web Page
    - Possible ability to make adjustments to program parameters via website.

Currently, I am working on getting the database integration smoothed out.
